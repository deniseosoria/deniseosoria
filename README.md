<h1>Hi, I'm Denise! <br/>

I started my journey in the beauty industry over 12 years ago, fresh out of high school, with a passion for helping people feel their best on their special day. It was rewarding work, but I eventually found myself craving a new challenge, one that pushed my creativity in a different way. That’s when I discovered software engineering, and I’ve been captivated ever since.

There’s something thrilling about problem-solving and bringing ideas to life through code. My passion led me to earn a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and most recently, I deepened my expertise with a Full-Stack Web Development certificate, where I dedicated over 500 classroom hours to hands-on coding and real-world projects.
